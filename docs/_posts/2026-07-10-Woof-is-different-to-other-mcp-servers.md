You can already ask an AI assistant to "find my photos from Spain." Most photo MCP servers either stop there — you get a list of filenames or paths back as text — or you have to switch to another app to actually look at anything. What sets Woof apart is what happens the moment after the search: you *see* your photos, browse them, flip through them, without ever leaving the conversation.

## The Landscape Today

As of today, none of Apple, Google, Microsoft, or Amazon has released an official MCP server for their own photo product — not Photos, not Google Photos, not OneDrive, not Amazon Photos (see **References** below).

That leaves a handful of community projects, each solving a different slice of the problem:

- **[drolosoft/immich-photo-manager](https://github.com/drolosoft/immich-photo-manager)** — CLIP-based natural-language search over a self-hosted Immich library, plus geographic and temporal album curation. Notably, it *does* produce a browsable surface: on request, it generates a self-contained HTML page with embedded thumbnails — closer to Woof than most competitors, but it's a file you open separately, not a view rendered live inside the conversation.
- **[barryw/ImmichMCP](https://github.com/barryw/ImmichMCP)** — the same Immich backend, with CLIP semantic search and structured metadata filters, but results come back as JSON with thumbnail/download URLs only. No gallery generation — you or your client has to render them.
- **[sweetrb/apple-photos-mcp](https://github.com/sweetrb/apple-photos-mcp)** — queries the macOS Photos library directly via `osxphotos`. Search is structured filters only — date range, album, keyword, person, favorite/hidden, title/description substring — no semantic or visual search. It's fully local with no credentials of any kind, but viewing a photo still means opening it in Photos.app or exporting it to disk.
- **[savethepolarbears/google-photos-mcp](https://github.com/savethepolarbears/google-photos-mcp)** — broader than pure metadata filtering: a genuine text search against the Google Photos API (leaning on Google's own backend categorization), plus structured filters and location search. It also ships a Picker API flow that opens *your browser* to Google's own picker UI — a real browsing surface, just not one rendered inside the AI conversation. And it requires a Google Cloud OAuth client ID and secret, plus a full consent flow, before any of it works.

None of them render a live, interactive photo gallery inside the AI conversation itself. The closest is immich-photo-manager's generated HTML gallery — and even that's a separate artifact, not something rendered live where you're chatting.

### How they stack up

| MCP server | Search | Browse in-chat | No credential sharing | Metadata editing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Woof** | 🟡 Full-text search on description + structured facets | ✅ Inline MCP App (grid/carousel/full-screen), rendered live in the conversation | ✅ Local-only, STDIO | ❌ Read-only, index-and-search only |
| drolosoft/immich-photo-manager | ✅ Semantic (CLIP) + facets (geo/temporal) | 🟡 Generates a separate HTML gallery page, not inline | ❌ Immich instance API key | ✅ Tags, bulk rotation, metadata repair (timestamps/GPS/timezone), trash/delete/restore, face merge |
| barryw/ImmichMCP | ✅ Semantic (CLIP) + facets | ❌ JSON + URLs only, no gallery | ❌ Immich instance API key | ✅ Asset metadata update, full album/tag CRUD, people update/merge, comments/likes |
| sweetrb/apple-photos-mcp | Structured facets (date/album/keyword/person) | ❌ JSON only, view in Photos.app or export | ✅ Local-only, no credentials | ❌ Explicitly read-only against the library, export-only |
| savethepolarbears/google-photos-mcp | ✅ Text search + structured facets | 🟡 Picker API opens Google's picker in the browser, not inline | ❌ Google OAuth client ID/secret | 🟡 Album create/upload/cover + album-level enrichment only, no per-photo rating/tag/caption |

A note on that last column: the two Immich-backed servers need an API key for the user's **own self-hosted** Immich instance — a smaller trust boundary than handing OAuth credentials to a third-party cloud API, even though both count as "a credential the MCP server holds."

Woof can combine many facets (date, rating, dimensions, orientation, tags, GPS, camera make/model/lens, ISO/aperture/shutter/focal length) and textual description. What it doesn't have yet is CLIP-style *visual* semantic search: finding a photo because it looks like a sunset, not because the word "sunset" appears somewhere in its tags or description. More on that below.

## Search and Browse, in One Place

Woof's gallery is an MCP App — an interactive view rendered directly inside the Claude conversation. Ask "show me the beach trip from 2024," and a live grid appears that you can scroll, switch to carousel, or open full-screen — all inline, with no context switch to another application. That's the core of what makes Woof different: not a smarter query, but not losing the thread when you go to actually look at the results.

## Refining What You're Looking At

Because search and browsing live in the same surface, you can narrow, broaden, or pivot the query conversationally while looking at what's on screen: "now just the ones with Mia," "zoom into that one," "go back a week." Competitors whose tool response is text can't support this — there's nothing on screen to point at.

## A Crowd of Agents Behind One Experience

Under the hood, Woof mediates a set of stateless agents — Wally handles query and browse, Whitebeard handles ingestion — behind this single conversational surface. That means the search-and-browse experience can keep growing (enrichment, memories, more agents) without the whole system becoming a monolith.

## No Credential Sharing

Several competitors require handing the MCP server a credential: Google Photos MCP needs a Google Cloud OAuth client ID and secret plus a full consent flow; the two Immich-backed servers need an API key for your Immich instance (a smaller trust boundary, since that's usually self-hosted, but still a credential the process holds). Woof is local-only — there are no API keys to generate, share, or revoke. The assistant talks to a local MCP server over STDIO, and there's no credential to leak because none exists.

## Your Metadata Stays Yours

Every fact Woof learns about a photo — tags, ratings, description, GPS, camera settings — is written to an [XMP sidecar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform) next to the original file, an open ISO standard that Lightroom, Darktable, and ExifTool can all read. The LanceDB index that powers search is just a local, rebuildable cache derived from those sidecars — not a proprietary database holding the only copy. Stop using Woof, and your metadata doesn't disappear with it: it's already sitting on your drive, in a format any tool can open.

## Where Woof Still Trails

Woof V1 only supports local and mounted drives. Competitors already run against a real, hosted or self-hosted multi-user server — a legitimate advantage if your library lives there. 

While Woof's structured facets and full-text description search cover a lot of ground, it isn't CLIP-style visual semantic search. "Sunset at the beach" only finds something if that language shows up in a tag, a keyword, or the description — most competitors search the actual pixel content of the photo. 

Also, Woof is not editing the metadata yet: rating, commenting, grouping into albums of tags.

## What's Next

Woof optimizes the *experience* of asking and then looking — search and browsing unified in one conversation, instead of a query that dumps you into a separate app to see the results. Backend breadth and visual semantic search are on the roadmap, not solved yet.
